This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Navigate to book-finder

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd book-api && npm i`
### `cd .. && cd book-app && npm i`

Open book-api and run the following command to start the backend

### `nodemon index.js`

Open book-app and run the following command to start the backend

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
